# LFDP-Crowns: Construction and Validation

This repository contains the supplementary codes for the data descriptor “LFDP-Crowns: a Large Dataset of Manually-Segmented Individual Tree Crowns in a Tropical Forest”. 

 

Individual tree crown (ITC) delineation, the procedure of automatic detection of individual crowns from remote sensing data, is a preliminary step for ecological studies at the tree level. For example, it plays a critical role in species classification and biomass and carbon stock assessment. We present a fully annotated dataset for the Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot (LFDP) in the Luquillo Experimental Forest in northeastern Puerto Rico (SW corner $18\degree20'$ N, $65\degree49'$ W). The forest is classified as a subtropical wet forest in the Holdridge life zone system and has an average annual rainfall of $3,500$ mm per year.
